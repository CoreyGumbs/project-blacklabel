                The quickest way to a man's heart is with Chuck Norris' fist. Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for his left and right legs. Chuck Norris is my Homeboy A Handicapped parking sign does not signify that this spot is for handicapped people. It is actually in fact a warning, that the spot belongs to Chuck Norris and that you will be handicapped if you park there.

                Chuck Norris can lead a horse to water AND make it drink. Chuck Norris is so fast, he can run around the world and punch himself in the back of the head Chuck Norris can win a game of Connect Four in only three moves There is no chin behind Chuck Norris' beard. There is only another fist. Chuck Norris is the only man to ever defeat a brick wall in a game of tennis There is no theory of evolution. Just a list of creatures Chuck Norris has allowed to live.

                A Handicapped parking sign does not signify that this spot is for handicapped people. It is actually in fact a warning, that the spot belongs to Chuck Norris and that you will be handicapped if you park there. Chuck Norris invented Kentucky Fried Chicken's famous secret recipe, with eleven herbs and spices. But nobody ever mentions the twelfth ingredient: Fear. Someone once videotaped Chuck Norris getting pissed off. It was called Walker: Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Chuck Norris is the only man to ever defeat a brick wall in a game of tennis Chuck Norris does not buy ground beef, he just takes a whole cow, runs it through his beard, and fully cooked hamburgers come out, Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chuck Norris has 72... and they're all poisonous Chuck Norris' hand is the only hand that can beat a Royal Flush.

                Chuck Norris once roundhouse kicked someone so hard that his foot broke the speed of light, went back in time, and killed Amelia Earhart while she was flying over the Pacific Ocean 911 dials Chuck Norris to see if there's any emergency he hasn't resolved yet. Chuck Norris usually laughs, When Chuck Norris does a pushup, he isn't lifting himself up, he's pushing the Earth down Chuck Norris thinks guns are for girls Contrary to popular belief, Chuck Norris, not the box jellyfish of northern Australia, is the most venomous creature on earth, Chuck Norris wears contacts. Not to see better mind you, but so he won't burn a hole through whatever it is he is looking at. Remember the Soviet Union? They decided to quit after watching a DeltaForce marathon on Satellite TV.
